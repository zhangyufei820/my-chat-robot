skin is smooth like porcelain, with a soft ivory tone and a pinkish glow. It appears plump, crystal-clear, and dewy radiating a gentle, moist sheen from 
within, especially on her cheeks, nose bridge, and forehead, like a natural water-glow effect. Her eyes are large, round almond-shaped with bright, glossy 
pupils, soft double eyelids, and a youthful sparkle expressive but gentle. The lower eyelid area is smooth and bright, without any wet marks or artificial 
shine. Her eyebrows are straight, softly feathered, and delicately arched at the ends, matching her hair color. Her cheeks are slightly puffy with natural 
apple-like fullness, adding to her youthful charm. Her nose is small and cute with a soft, straight bridge. Her lips are full and soft with a defined Cupid’s 
bow, slightly glossy as if naturally moisturized. The corners of her lips curve upward gently, giving a subtle, sweet smile. Her chin is short and softly 
rounded, completing a tender, well-balanced, and feminine facial structure with an overall innocent and adorable aura."
